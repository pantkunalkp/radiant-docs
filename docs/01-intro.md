# Introduction

**[Radiant](#) (Intugine's design system) is a collection of resources and guidelines, that work together to create user interfaces consistent with the design language of Intugine.**

When it comes to designing for a large number of enterprise-level products, designers often face the hurdle of decision-making. Without standards set in place, decisions become arbitrary and difficult to critique. As applications and their teams age, they build design and technical debt. This is seen as an overabundance of non-resuable and inconsistent styles and conventions, and it becomes impossible to maintain them. To match the rapid growth of technology, design systems have proven to be a dependable solution.

Radiant was created as a product of such learnings and experiences. This very first version focuses on the most common design elements, such as colors, typography, components etc. and aims to uniform the work design and tech teams have done so far.

Please note that the system is not 'one and done', meaning it needs to continuously evolve with new standards and improvements as needs arise.
